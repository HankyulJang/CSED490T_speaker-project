    21 sneezing
    16 wind0
    26 laughing
    42 siren -> 12

2. I made a network exactly same with the paper (Yuji Tokozume),
   but it is too big nets, so I cannot handle on my desktop
   if we want to make same nets with the paper, we need several parallel computers, which is impossible.
   so, I downsized the network.
